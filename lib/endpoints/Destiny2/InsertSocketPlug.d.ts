 * Insert a plug into a socketed item. I know how it sounds, but I assure you it's
 * much more G-rated than you might be guessing. We haven't decided yet whether
 * this will be able to insert plugs that have side effects, but if we do it will
 * require special scope permission for an application attempting to do so. You
 * must have a valid Destiny Account, and either be in a social space, in orbit, or
 * offline. Request must include proof of permission for 'InsertPlugs' from the
 * account owner.
 *
 * Wait at least 0.5s between actions.
